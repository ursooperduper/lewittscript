# LeWittScript

## Background

[Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) was an american conceptualist/minimalist known especially for his wall drawings. The wall drawings were created from sets of instructions and executed directly on a wall with various media, usually by someone other than the artist himself. As LeWitt desired, this meant that each time a piece was executed, the interpretation of the person executing the work meant the final piece would change slightly.

## The LeWittScript Project

The LeWittScript projects seeks to provide a creative playground based on the art of Sol LeWitt. With a simple scripting language that looks more like natural language than code, LeWittScript will allow anyone to write a simple set of instructions that can be interpreted by LeWittScript's parser and drawn to the screen.
