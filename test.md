# LeWittScript Spec

## Status

This document is a work in progress. The basics of LeWittScript are still being envisioned and in an experimental stage. So this document can be expected to update often.

## Introduction

LeWittScript is a simple scripting language that allows anyone to create works of art based on the work of minimalist and conceptualist artist, Sol LeWitt.

Rather than requiring users to learn a scripting language, LeWittScript uses natural language to describe the artwork that's created.

This document provides examples of instructions that might be provided by an user, an explanation of the elements/keywords that make up an instruction, and the entire LeWittScript project.

## Terminology

**Instruction** - A parsed set of elements/keywords that the app can draw onto the canvas.

**Element** - An individual item (word or set of words) in an instruction that can be acted upon.

**Statement** - When the artist first enters input into the LeWittScript app, it is considered a statement.
